# Shopping Mall Annual Financial Performance Analysis
## Project Overview
Understanding customer behavior and financial perfomance is necessary for strategic decision-making. This data analysis presents a detailed examination of a shopping mall's financial performance, with emphasis on gender-based insights. By scrutinizing the total number of male and female customers, individual spending patterns, annual income distributions, and revenue generation across genders, the analysis aims to provide comprehensive insights into the mall's operational landscape. Additionally, key performance indicators (KPIs) are employed to gauge the overall performance metrics, including annual revenue, expenditure, and income. By harnessing the power of data visualization and analytics, I aim to uncover actionable insights that can inform marketing strategies, resource allocation, and overall business optimization.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- Total annual revenue: Reflects the overall financial performance of the mall.
- Annual expenditure: Provides insights into the overall expenditure for the year
- Annual income: Indicates the purchasing power and potential growth prospects.
  ## This Analysis aims to answer the following questions:
- Gender Demographics: Total number of male and female customers visiting the mall.
- Spending Behavior: Annual amount spent by each gender within the mall.
- Annual Income Analysis: Distribution of annual income among male and female customers.
- Revenue Generation: Annual revenue generated by male and female customers.
